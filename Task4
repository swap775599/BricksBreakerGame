Brick Breaker Game

Project Overview:
Create a Java programming project called "Brick Breaker Game" that challenges players to
demolish bricks using a paddle and ball, combining classic gameplay with modern graphics
and interactive features.

Project Details:
• The game will feature a paddle and ball, with the objective of breaking bricks.
• Players can control the paddle to bounce the ball and break bricks.
• Bricks will be arranged in patterns or levels, and players progress by breaking all the
bricks in each level.
• The game will include features such as score tracking, power-ups, and multiple levels
of increasing difficulty.

1. To create an Online Survey System in Java, you can follow these steps:
• Setup: Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
• Graphics: Utilize a graphics library like JavaFX or Swing to design the game window,
paddle, ball, and bricks.
• Game Elements: Implement classes for the paddle, ball, and bricks, including their
movement and interactions.
• Collision Detection: Develop algorithms to detect collisions between the ball, paddle,
and bricks.

• Game Loop: Create a game loop to continuously update the game state and handle
player input.
• Scoring: Keep track of the player's score as they break bricks and achieve milestones.
• Levels: Design multiple levels with different brick arrangements and challenges.
• Power-Ups: Introduce power-ups that modify the ball's behavior or provide other
advantages to the player.
• Sound Effects: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects for actions like ball
collisions and brick breaks.
• Game Over: Implement conditions for ending the game, such as when all bricks are
destroyed or the player loses all their lives.
As for the choice of code editor, you can use any Java-compatible code editor or IDE, such as
Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code. Choose the one you are most comfortable with or
feel suits your needs best.
